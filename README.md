## Praxis

Documentation spans several areas:

Source code

: Documentation relevant to source code belongs _with_ the source code. Each Bitbucket or Github project must have its own dedicated `readme.md` file that provides relevant details about the _source code_.

Packages

: Package definition


Integration

: Integration doc
