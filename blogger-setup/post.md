## Blogger Setup for Markdown

This blog is now hosted on GitHub: 

    https://github.com/nkabir/praxis

It's a collection of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) pages along with links to images hosted in a [public Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r9qw876n8teix61/ZYDcDxLTn4/praxis). This enables me to edit everything in [vim](http://www.vim.org/)

## Project Layout

The `praxis` project is laid out with a folder per article. Each folder (e.g. `praxis/blogger-setup`) has a file named `post.md` that represents the article. There is a corresponding folder `Dropbox/Public/praxis/blogger-setup` that contains all images associated with the article.
