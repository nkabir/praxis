## Blogger Setup for Markdown

This blog is now hosted on GitHub: 

    https://github.com/nkabir/praxis

It's a collection of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) pages along with links to images hosted in a [public Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r9qw876n8teix61/ZYDcDxLTn4/praxis). This enables me to edit everything in [vim](http://www.vim.org/).
