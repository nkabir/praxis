## Installation

The Google client libraries are installed via `pip`. 

    $ pip install google-api-python-client

`mint` has a dependency on these libraries and installs them when it's installed. Documentation for the library is available at [http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/](http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/)
