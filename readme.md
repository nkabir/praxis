## Praxis

Documentation spans several areas:


* **Source code** Documentation relevant to source code belongs _with_ the source code. Each Bitbucket or Github project must have its own dedicated `readme.md` file that provides relevant details about the _source code_.
* **Packages** Documentation for packages is stored in the appropriate distribution project. For example, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is [available here](https://bitbucket.org/autonomy/blackbox-12.04).
* **Integration** Documentation for integration (setting up and deploying services) is available on [http://praxis.rocketknowledge.com](http://praxis.rocketknowledge.com) and the associated Github repository at [https://www.github.com/nkabir/praxis](https://www.github.com/nkabir/praxis).
